# gnhf

Launch a bounded, low-supervision overnight (or long-unattended) coding
agent run against one well-specced task, in an isolated git worktree. One
agent, one task, minimally supervised until it finishes, bails, or its
bound expires. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full behavior.

## Quickstart

Invoke it by slash command, or just describe what you want in normal
conversation — the description in `SKILL.md` is enough for most agents to
pick it up on their own.

| Agent | Command |
| ----- | ------- |
| Claude Code | `/gnhf <task-id-or-description> [ttl] [max-turns]` |
| opencode | describe the task in chat; opencode loads the skill from its description — this is the default unattended agent, driven through opencode's own server API with a live TUI attached in a Herdr pane when available |
| pi | `/skill:gnhf <task-id-or-description> [ttl] [max-turns]` — still supported as a secondary agent |

## Parameters

All parameters are optional except the task itself.

- **`task-id-or-description`** — the task to run, however this repo tracks
  it: a Backlog.md task ID, a `TODO.md` entry, a GitHub issue, or a plain
  description if the repo has no tracker. Must be well-specced (concrete
  acceptance criteria, prior art in the repo, no judgment calls) — the
  skill screens for this and picks a different task, or asks you to
  respecify, if it isn't.
- **`ttl`** — wall-clock budget in seconds before the run is killed via
  `timeout`. Defaults to `86400` (24 hours) if omitted.
- **`max-turns`** — turn/iteration bound, only meaningful when the agent is
  invoked once per turn with session continuation. Most single-invocation
  agent CLIs run their own internal tool-call loop, so `ttl` alone already
  bounds those; omit this unless you specifically want turn-level control.

## Configuration

`scripts/gnhf.py`'s defaults can be overridden per machine without editing
the script: set the env var directly, or copy `.env.example` to `.env` in
this same directory (resolved relative to the script, not the caller's
cwd; gitignored). A CLI flag always wins over either.

| Env var | Default | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GNHF_PROVIDER` | unset | smoke-test |
| `GNHF_MODEL` | unset | smoke-test |
| `GNHF_TIMEOUT` | `300` | smoke-test |
| `GNHF_MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | smoke-test |
| `GNHF_TTL` | `86400` | launch |
| `GNHF_PROBE` | `25` | launch |
| `GNHF_BASE_BACKOFF` | `75` | launch |
| `GNHF_MAX_BACKOFF` | `900` | launch |
| `GNHF_MAX_429` | `6` | launch |
| `GNHF_TOTAL_BACKOFF_CAP` | `2700` | launch |

## Example

```text
/gnhf TASK-042 7200
```

Runs task `TASK-042` with a 2-hour wall-clock budget, default agent/model
resolution, no turn limit.

## What happens after

The skill reports back one of: `DONE` (reviewed, pushed, and merged),
`BAILED` (blocked, nothing pushed), `RATE_LIMITED` or `EARLY_EXIT` (the
task never got a turn — a launch that died on gateway contention or a real
dispatch failure, not an outcome of the task itself), TTL-expired, or
killed for thrashing — along with the worktree and log paths for manual
review. If the agent is `opencode`, a Herdr pane running the live TUI
stays open for you to inspect the finished session directly. See
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md) steps 5-7 for the launch, monitoring, and finish
protocol.
